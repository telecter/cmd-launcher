## `minecraft-launcher`

A basic command line Minecraft launcher.

### Usage

To start the latest version, run the binary. `./minecraft-launcher`. This will
download libraries, assets, and the client.

### Not Implemented

## Warning!

This launcher does not yet implement authentication. This means you can run it
without owning a copy of Minecraft. **Doing so is considered piracy.**
